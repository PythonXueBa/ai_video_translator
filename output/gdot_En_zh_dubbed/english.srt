1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
First off, thank you for the incredible support on my last video.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,640
As we all know, things stay time.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,880
So today, I want to save you some time and jumpstart your cadeau journey with the lessons

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,280
I wish I knew when I first started.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,600
If I could go back and just tell myself 10 things about cadeau, I would have saved myself

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,359
dozens of broken projects and a whole lot of frustration.

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,559
So today, I'm giving you everything I wish I knew before you even opened your door.

8
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,200
I've been using the cadeau engine for more than 5 years now and I've watched it grow

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,159
from a niche tool into a powerhouse engine.

10
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,799
Even a huge game like Battlefield 6 uses it as the technology behind the community map

11
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,679
editor and the portal creation toolkit that comes with the game as a level editor.

12
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:53,519
But when I first started, I had no idea what I was doing and honestly, the things I'm

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,120
about to share with you would have sped up my learning by months.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,800
So whether you're brand new or just getting serious about cadeau in 2026, this video is

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
for you.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,439
But before you even open your first cadeau project, let's talk about the biggest decision

17
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,960
every beginner struggles with.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,879
New devs always ask the same question, should I jump straight into the engine or do I need

19
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,400
to learn programming first?

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,879
And here's the truth, if you already understand the basics of programming like what are

21
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,839
variables, functions and loops, then yes, absolutely jump into cadeau.

22
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:33,439
In fact, cadeau is designed to teach you as you build, but there's one thing you absolutely

23
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,119
must do first, get familiar with the cadeau docs.

24
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,599
No really, hear me out, I know this seems boring, but go through the getting started section

25
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,959
in the official cadeau documentation.

26
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,439
It's short, simple and teaches you the exact fundamentals cadeau expects you to know.

27
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,599
And make sure you do the example project.

28
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:57,479
Your first 2D game, if you're brand new to programming, then I suggest learning the basics

29
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,479
first.

30
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,000
They're not a sponsor, but honestly, GD Quest has one of the best beginner friendly foundations

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
out there.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,959
The learn GD script from zero course, it's free, it's clean, it's simple and made for

33
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,359
total beginners.

34
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:16,359
Now once you're comfortable inside the editor, there's one habit that can save your future

35
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:18,159
self so much pain.

36
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,560
Let's talk about that next.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,759
One of the biggest mistakes I made when I just started out was writing code that only

38
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,759
I could understand and trust me, if you do this in 6 months, you won't understand it either.

39
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,759
To avoid that, always write readable code.

40
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,240
Use clear variable names like player speed and not PS1.

41
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,840
Use descriptive function names like player movement instead of just movement and break

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,920
big functions into smaller single purpose ones where practical.

43
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,679
Your goal is simple, write code today that future you can understand instantly because

44
00:02:54,679 --> 00:03:00,560
readable code makes debugging so much easier, but even clean code won't help you if you

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,679
don't know where to find answers.

46
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:09,000
And GDOS has a massively underrated resource.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,959
One of the best habits you can learn early is static typing.

48
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,639
This means telling GDOS what type of data a variable should have.

49
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,159
Just like this, bar speed colon float equals 200.0.

50
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,319
Instead of bar speed equal 200.0.

51
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,559
Why this is matter?

52
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:31,279
Because GDOS will warn you about errors before you run the game.

53
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:37,000
It catches type mismatches, wrong arguments and a ton of subtle bugs you don't want to

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,239
deal with later.

55
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,719
And here two more best practices every beginner should know.

56
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:46,159
Don't put heavy logic in the process and physics process function.

57
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,359
If something doesn't need to run every frame, don't put it in process or physics process

58
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:53,599
that really slows things down.

59
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,439
And can make debugging messy.

60
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,719
Don't create super deep node hierarchies.

61
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,560
Keep your scenes organized by grouping related things together.

62
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,639
The node tree is your architecture so use it wisely.

63
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,120
And if you ever want the official full list of best practices, here it is.

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,960
Alright, now let's get into the fun part.

65
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,480
These are 10 workflow shortcuts that completely changed how enjoyable GDOS is for me.

66
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,040
Even if some of these don't make sense yet.

67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,600
Just take notes and keep them in mind as you do your research.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,040
Trust me, learning these will save you hours or even days later.

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Tip 1.

70
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,680
Learn signals early.

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,519
Signals are everywhere in GDOS.

72
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,680
And one of the reasons the engine is so flexible.

73
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,400
Learn how to use them early.

74
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,759
This will make your life so much easier.

75
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,839
I personally wish I had spent more time on this when I first started.

76
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,839
Tip 2.

77
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,399
Use separate scenes for reusable elements.

78
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,000
Things like help bars, enemy bullets, or even a UI panel.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,360
Make each of these its own scene.

80
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,879
That way you can reuse it anywhere in your project without having to rebuild it every

81
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,879
time.

82
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,879
Tip 3.

83
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,959
Make Duplicated Nodes Unique.

84
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,839
Whenever you duplicate a node, use the Make Unique option.

85
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:17,319
If you don't, resources like collision shapes or scripts might be shared between nodes.

86
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,919
And that can lead to really tricky bugs.

87
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,159
Taking the simple steps saves so much headache.

88
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,159
Tip 4.

89
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:25,479
Keep Scenes Modular.

90
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,279
Try to build small chunks instead of one giant scene.

91
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,599
Modular scenes makes your game easier to manage, debug, and expand later.

92
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,319
I learned this the hard way.

93
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,319
After making one too many massive messy scenes.

94
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,319
Tip 5.

95
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,599
Reuse Functions Across Scripts.

96
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:47,560
Whenever you have logics that is used more than once, put it in a helper script.

97
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,560
Reusing Functions This way keeps your code cleaner and prevents you

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,639
from rewriting the same logic over and over.

99
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,639
Tip 6.

100
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,959
Learn Autolodes.

101
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,439
The Singleton Pattern.

102
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:04,519
Autolodes are perfect for global systems like scores, audio managers, or save data.

103
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,560
Once you get comfortable with them, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them.

104
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Tip 7.

105
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,120
Use Node Groups.

106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,799
Groups let you target multiple nodes at once.

107
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:17,759
For example, you can target all doors or all ladders.

108
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,519
Then you can send a single command and affect everything in that group.

109
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,039
It's a huge time saver.

110
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,039
Tip 8.

111
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,039
Master the Animation Player node early.

112
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,479
Animation Player is not just for fancy animations.

113
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,720
It can control UI transitions, effects, and even gameplay sequences.

114
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,960
Once you understand it, it's one of the most powerful tools in Kado.

115
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Tip 9.

116
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,080
Turn on Debug Options.

117
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,319
Things like collision shapes, navigation, measures, and physics debugging are life savers.

118
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,520
I've spent hours hunting down bugs that I could have seen immediately by enabling these

119
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,200
options early on.

120
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,199
Tip 10.

121
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,560
Use De Debugger and Profiler.

122
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,199
The Debugger and Profiler are there to catch problems before they even become nightmares.

123
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,399
Most beginners don't even touch them, but I promise if you start using them, it will

124
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,279
save you hours of trial and error.

125
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,639
And after all these steps, here's something everyone thinking about learning the dough and

126
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,519
game development in general should know.

127
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,599
Now I have to be straight here.

128
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,520
Game development is just like any other skill.

129
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,640
When you start, you don't know what you're doing, you don't know the techniques.

130
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
And you know what?

131
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
That's okay.

132
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,160
The dough is improving fast.

133
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,480
Version 4.6 is already out, but don't wait for the perfect version.

134
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,400
If you keep waiting for the next big release, then you know what?

135
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
You'll never start.

136
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,840
The fastest way to learn is to start building small projects.

137
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,040
Now, not your dream RPG.

138
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Make a platformer.

139
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
It's up down shooter.

140
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,879
A simple physics game or even a UI prototype.

141
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,920
Each small project teaches you something new.

142
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,080
That's how you level up.

143
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,360
And if you ever feel stuck, here's what you should do next.

144
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,480
Follow these tips, subscribe and join in the discussion.

145
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,360
That's how you can jumpstart your journey with Gadoo.

146
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,759
If you like the video, smash that like button so the video reaches more people that may

147
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,759
need it.

148
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,240
And I also want to hear from you.

149
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,600
Are you already using Gadoo or experimenting with AI in your workflow?

150
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,400
Drop a comment below and let's talk.

151
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,879
I'll be checking the comments regularly and I read every single one and get back to

152
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,879
you.

153
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,360
Until next time, thanks for watching.

154
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Happy coding.

155
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,120
Keep experimenting and I'll see you in the comments.

156
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,000
This has been The Raku Games.
